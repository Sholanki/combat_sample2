  title: Why Jeet Kune Do
  description: >
    Jeet Kune Do (JKD) is the worlds most wanted Martial Art today. Jeet
Kune Do was founded by the legendary Martial artist Bruce Lee & it
represents his martial art, philosophy and way of life. The Jeet Kune Do
Ideology is our understanding of jeet Kune Do. In India, JKD is under
tutelage of the authors Dr's Rao. They are full instructors under Sifu
Richard Bustillo, the Iron Dragon of JKD, one of Bruce Lee's prominent
original students, also a founding member of Bruce Lee Foundation & one
who along with Dan Inosanto, opened up the IMB academy, the first JKD
School to open after Lee's passing away.
Despite his small size, (5 feet 7 inch & 57 kgs) Lee proved that in fighting,
SIZE is not everything & by scientific technic, one can knock down a
heavier, taller & aggressive man. His revolutionary principles of fighting
and the deep philosophical approach form the basis of now world famous
JKD.
In 1972 before his death, Lee ordered closing down of all his schools
teaching his art, Jeet Kune Do, which was Chinese Kung Fu based. After
his death, Enter the Dragon was released and the world went crazy
after Lee‟s Martial art and wanted to learn it.
But Jeet Kune Do was unavailable for learning. At that time, only Japanese
Karate was available. Karate got marketed as Lee‟s art and suddenly a
hundred thousand Karate schools cropped up in various parts of the world.
A Few years after Lees death, JKD was taught for the first time by Dan
Inosanto & Richard Bustillo at Filipino Kali Academy & later at IMB
Academy – International Martial arts & Boxing Academy in Torrance, USA.
JKD India is under the blessings of Richard Bustillo, the Iron Dragon.
India JKD is taught not only as a martial art, but also as a
concept – a method of self discovery, in the following apects- 
(a) Physical combative aspects,
(b) Aspects of Problem solving, attaining Goals & of Living comfortably in
the real world
(c) Finally venturing into the Philosophical with focus on building the right
approach, core value in life & character – Bushido, the Samurai code of
honour.
